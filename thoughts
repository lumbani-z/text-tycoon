This one took much longer than expected. IF you've seen the previous program, this was a fairly large step up in scope.

The formula for tycoon games already exists in numerous mobile games, so spending hours playing them to understand the systems counts as R&D right?

But honestly, looking at these tycoon games from the lense of someone trying to recreate the features and progression was eye opening as I had never given them much thought before.

That took up most of my time. I also spend a while figuring out how to deal with flickers, and many, many days modifying update logic for time, cost, and revenue

But it was fun seeing the game take shape. The moment I saw real time asynchronous progress bars I felt like I was a gamedev for a moment haha

ANSI codes were not as fun though...

I chose to use ANSI code partly becuase I was including so many modules that I still don't fully understand, so at somepoint I decided against ncurses. 
But also because of this article https://xn--rpa.cc/irl/term.html Maybe ANSI codes are the way, maybe they aren't

I realize now however, that using some form of graphics would have made this project easier.

But, playing the full working version after suffering through terminal issues really did feel like I was finding some footing, but there's always more to learn

Going forward, I will probably do one more terminal project or I might just jump to graphics right away.

I just need to think of another game to copy

thats all
