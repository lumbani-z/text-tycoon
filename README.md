# Project 2: Text Tycoon
This is an introductory look at cpp.

This is the second of a series of projects that will expose me to the basics in the language.

The goal of this project is to replicate the idle tycoon game format in a text based format. Using the already existing formula, I intend to further explore conditionals and look at non-synchronous time based updates

Once again, I have created music and sound effects for the project.
