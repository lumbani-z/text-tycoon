# Project 2: Text Tycoon (windows)
This is an introductory look at cpp.

This is the second of a series of projects that will expose me to the basics in the language.

The goal of this project is to replicate the idle tycoon game format in a text based format.

## Features
- Smooth real-time terminal UI (no flicker)
- Sound effects and music using SFML
- Unlockable upgrades with increasing complexity
- 1x / 10x / 100x / MAX buying modes
